We need to establish a coding standard, so all of our code looks the same. This will be an extensive document, and will talk about things you don't know yet. If you don't know what a certain clause refers to, then you can ignore it for now.

There will be the occasional funny relevant comic to make sure this isn't too boring.

# Why?

Without a Styleguide, this was the condition of programming team:

* At least one hole in the wall every season
* Always 2 weeks late on the promised deadline
* 1 very expensive item and 2 copies that is extensively experimented with only to be scrapped the day before Dallas regional, such as Kinect, NUC, LED's, or Jetson.
* 5 repos with names such as "finalCompCode," "realCode," "finalCompCode2017ACTUAL." But the actual repo with the competition code is "PRAC-COMP-CODE-2017"
* More humorous comments and puns in code than actual helpful documentation, such as woaver
* Building a turret when no one else would
* Forgetting to plug in the router
* Arguments over singleton vs static functions \(both are almost functionally identical\)
* Code purges over disagreements of styles
* Cheating on programming quizzes
* The inability to write an HTTP server
* Calculating the price of pizza for the team
* Not wanting to eat pizza
* Withstanding yelling from Eric, Michael, Burnham, and any other student who happens to be on the field when the robot inevitably goes haywire.
* Enduring many cuts on sharp pieces of metal trying to reach the RoboRIO on Themis
* Spending $200 for an IR sensor
* Wasting numerous LED strips and Arduinos for no purpose
* Having to skip dinner to fix the code
* Drama with all of the other teams

Not all of these problems will be fixed quickly. But a defined Styleguide is a step in the right direction.
