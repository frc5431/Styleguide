### Adding changes on a whim

We all know that feeling. That feeling when you are thinking of a new feature and are getting really excited to add it and see it in action. It's fun to just add a bunch of cool features, but it is imperative that EVERY THING YOU ADD IS TESTED.

Even by adding 1 minor line of code, you must test the whole function again.

Sounds annoying, but this makes sure we don't have the robot spinning around during autonomous or inverted controls.

If you want to add cool prototype features, you can create a new branch called `unstable` and push to there. Once it is tested and proven to be 100% working, merge with `master`.
