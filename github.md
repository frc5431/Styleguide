If you are writing code for Titan Robotics, you must put the code in this organization, `frc5431`. Commit as frequently as possible. Commit titles should be brief, preferably under 50 characters, and commit descriptions should be as descriptive as possible.

If you are writing competition-critical code and competition is coming up, save the best working version to the `master` branch of the repo. Continue prototyping and pushing code to another branch which could be named `unstable` or `proto`.
