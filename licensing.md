# Licensing and Credit

People do want credit for their own credit and work for their code.
Yet you can't just assume code is yours so Titan Robotics will have their own header. The header is located in a file called `LICENSE` in this repo. This header must be present in every file you create for Team 5431. Replace `<class documentation>` with JavaDoc style documentation for the class you are writing, and replace `<your name>` with your own name.
